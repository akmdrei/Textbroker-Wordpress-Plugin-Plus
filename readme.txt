== Description ==
This plugin modification of the Textbroker Wordpress Plugin 2.6 (http://www.textbroker.de/wordpress/) adds hooks to the original plugin


The hooks are fired, when a preview of a text is shown (so you can modify the view of a text bought from Textbroker)

and also when the article is published.

A plugin that leverages this functionality is: https://github.com/akmdrei/Textbroker-Enhance

There you can also find screenshots where a highlight funtion on SEO-keywords was implemented


Important:

It is very important, that if you clone this repository OR if you upload it via FTP the resulting directory in the /wp-content/plugins must be named "Textbroker-WordPress-Plugin"

The native Textbroker-Plugin on which this mod is based does not support relative paths.


This plugin is Multi-Site compatible!

== Installation ==


1. Upload the archive contents to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
